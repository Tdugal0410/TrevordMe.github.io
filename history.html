        I was born April 10, 2000 In bangor Maine. I lived in Bangor for about three years before we moved across the river over to Brewer. I attended All Saints Catholic School in Bangor all the way up until high school and attended Brewer High school. which was my first experience with a public school. Now I attend the University of Maine as a business major. The picture below is me when I was a little kid.
